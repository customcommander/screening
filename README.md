0.  What's the difference between `call()` and `apply()`?
    How and why would you use them?

0.  Write a function that tells me if a word is an anagram or a palindrome of another word.

    A palindrome is a word that you can read both ways (e.g. `abba`).
    An anagram is a word that contains every letters of another word (e.g. `rome` and `more`).

    Example:

    ```javascript
    is_anagram_or_palindrome(word_a, word_b); // true or false
    ```

    NB: You don't need to do parameters validation.
